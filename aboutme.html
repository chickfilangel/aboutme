	<h3>Biography</h3>
	
	<p>Most of my interests revolve around either the film or fashion industry. These are definitely two majors I'm keeping in mind for college. Ideally, the college of my dreams is FIT. Whether I continue down the film path or the fashion path, FIT has both majors and just seems like a perfect place to kickstart my future. Something else I'd also consider pursuing is journalism. It's something I grew up doing and would like to continue. </p>
	<p>I like spending free time by myself. Some hobbies of mine include journaling, singing and reading. I have a turtle and his name is Arthur. He's a red eared slider that I bought two and a half years ago.</p>
